        <h2>Andre N. Borges</h2>
        <h2>"Borges"</h2>
        <p> My Name is Andr√©. I have few nicknames, but most people call me by my last name, Borges!</p>
        <p>What I love, most, about BUYI is the fact that it provides a good
        education and with spiritual focus. I can feel the necessity to learn,
        as part of a greater meaning. <br>
        Another thing, is that it has strict deadlines and due dates.. in my
        case, I learn much better in face to face environment, because of my
        tight/unpredictable schedule, so online is a challenge for me. But, in
        BYUI, it is clear what is expected and by when, so it is less dificult
        to follow.</p>
        <p>I've been a member of the church since 1995, when I was 15. I served a
        mission in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for 2 years, got married in 2003,
        served as bishop for 6 years, and now I serve as member of stake high
        concil and Young men stake President.</p>
        <p>I have the most beautiful wife and children there is. My oldest son is 17 years old and is now preparing to serve
        a mission. <br>
        My oldest daugther is 16 and is talented in the Piano, and my youngest daugther love to sing and has a beautiful
        voice</p>
        <p>As a brazilian, I love playing soccer, Jiu-jitsu and voleyball, but I also enjoy
        reading and listening to music.</p>
